To run this example, the power system software PST needs to be installed on the computer and access to the PST folder given to matlab.

From this folder run the command 
$ s_simu

Then choose dmafan3area.m file from the menu window that appears.

Click Ok for all the following boxes (does not need to be changed from 100MWA and 60 Hz), leave calculate load flow blank.

To adjust the simulation time, edit the dmafan3area.m file; you can read the PST manual to understand the instructions written for this.
